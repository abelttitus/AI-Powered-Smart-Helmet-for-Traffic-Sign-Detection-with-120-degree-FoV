# AI Powered Smart Helmet for Traffic Sign Detection with 120 degree FoV

This Edge Impulse project implements a real-time, high PoV, on-device road sign detection and alerting system using the Arduino Nicla Vision. The goal is to prototype an “AI Helmet” that can detect critical road signs and provide immediate alerts to two-wheeler riders.


## ✨ Highlights

## Key Features

- **Fully on-device Edge AI** – Detection and alerts run entirely on the [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-vision) using TinyML + FOMO, eliminating the need for cloud connectivity or smartphone support for core operation.

- **Compact yet high-performance model** – Uses a **FOMO MobileNetV2 0.35**, **INT8 quantized**, occupying ~**81.3 KB flash** and ~**137.7 KB RAM**, while achieving **61 ms inference time per frame** (**16.3 FPS**) for smooth real-time detection.

- **Wide field-of-view perception** – A **120° field of view (FoV)** is achieved using a **three-camera setup**, significantly improving environmental awareness compared to a single forward-facing camera.

- **Helmet-mounted, rider-centric perspective** – Model is trained on data captured from a **helmet-level viewpoint**, ensuring alignment with real riding conditions and improving robustness.

- **End-to-end Edge pipeline** – Complete workflow:  
  **on-device data collection → labeling & augmentation → FOMO training in Edge Impulse → deployment via OpenMV/MicroPython → real-time inference and alerting**

- **Multi-modal safety feedback** – Provides instant alerts through **on-frame overlays**, **RGB LED indicators**, along with **real-time audio feedback via Bluetooth using a text-to-speech system** for intuitive rider interaction.

## 🚥 Problem Statement

Riders — motorcyclists and cyclists — often miss or fail to react to traffic signs in time due to limited field of view, distractions, or poor visibility. This poses a significant road safety risk, especially in traffic-dense Indian road environments.

* Limited FOV
* Reaction Delay
* No Feedback

However, two-wheeler riders often fail to notice or correctly interpret these signs due to:

* Visual clutter in dense urban environments
* Poor illumination or adverse weather
* Fatigue, distraction, or high cognitive load in traffic


## System Block Diagram

This project addresses that gap by exploring how existing helmets can be transformed into an **AI Helmet** using a compact, low-power Edge AI device. The system perceives its surroundings through computer vision, enhanced by a **three-camera setup providing a wide 120° field of view**, enabling reliable detection of important signboards in real time. It actively alerts riders through **real-time audio feedback via Bluetooth using text-to-speech**, ensuring critical information is conveyed instantly without requiring visual attention.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objective is to develop a prototype AI Helmet module that:

* Captures the rider’s forward-facing view using a compact camera
* Detects several categories of road and place-identification signs in real time
* Provides immediate feedback via:

  * Visual overlays (bounding boxes + labels)
  * Audio feed back using Bluetooth speaker
* Runs **entirely on-device** on a microcontroller-class edge platform (Arduino Nicla Vision), with **no cloud dependency**

The prototype demonstrates an **end-to-end Edge Impulse pipeline**:

> Data collection → Dataset & labels → FOMO model training → On-device deployment → Real-time alerts in a helmet-mounted setup.

## 🧱 Hardware Platform

**Core device:** [Arduino Nicla Vision](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-vision)

Nicla Vision is used because it combines:

* 📷 **2 MP color camera**
* 🧠 **1 MB RAM** and **16 MB QSPI flash**
* 📏 **Tiny form factor** suitable for helmet or bike mounting
* 💻 Support for **MicroPython**, **OpenMV**, and **Wi-Fi**

These capabilities make it possible to:

* Capture road scenes from a **helmet-like viewpoint**
* Run **Edge AI / TinyML models locally**
* Stream **annotated video** to a browser (for debugging and visualization)

---

## 📸 Data Collection

Data collection is done directly **on the Nicla Vision** using the scripts in `data-collection/`:

* A **USB power bank** powers the setup for portable use.
* A **MicroPython script** running on the Nicla Vision:

  * Captures an image from the onboard camera

Using this simple setup, we collected images of **real sign boards** around the IISc.

---

## 🧮 Dataset & Augmentation

The captured images are imported into **Edge Impulse** for dataset preparation.


* Cropping and mild geometric transforms
* Grayscale conversion and brightness/exposure changes
* Hue and saturation adjustments
* Blur and noise injection

**Sign-board classes:**

* `Go slow`
* `No honking`
* `Parking`
* `Road hump`
* `Speed limit`

**Dataset stats:**

* ~30 images per sign class
* **172 images total** across all classes
* An additional **background class** (added by Edge Impulse) represents scenes with **no sign board**, helping the model distinguish meaningful signs from ordinary road backgrounds.

---

## 🏷️ Annotation & Labeling

Bounding box annotation is carried out inside **Edge Impulse** using its labeling interface:

* All labels are then **manually generated** where needed.

This  strategy significantly speeds up labeling while maintaining high annotation quality suitable for embedded object detection.

---

## 🧠 Model Design: FOMO for TinyML

We use **Edge Impulse FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects)** for TinyML-based object detection.

### Model Architecture

* Backbone: **MobileNetV2 0.35** (lightweight CNN)
* Detection head: **FOMO** (grid-based object detection)
* Designed to provide **class + approximate location** while fitting into a **microcontroller** memory and compute budget.

### Input Configuration

* Input image: **96 × 96 RGB**
* Flattened feature dimension: **27,648 (96 × 96 × 3)**

### Output Classes

The model predicts **5 object classes** (non-background):


* `Go_slow`
* `Parking`
* `Road_hump`
* `Spped30`
* `NoHorn`

### Train / Test Split

* **79%** of samples used for **training**
* **21%** used for **testing**
* **20% of the training set** is further reserved as a **validation set**

---

## 🧪 Training Details (Edge Impulse)

The Keras-based object detection block in Edge Impulse uses a **FOMO-specific training script** with:

* **Loss:** Weighted cross-entropy (using `object_weight` to emphasize objects vs. background)
* **Epochs:** `100`
* **Learning rate:** `0.001`
* **Batch size:** `128`
* **Backbone width multiplier (alpha):** `0.35`
* **Checkpointing:** Best weights selected based on **validation F1 score (`val_f1`)**

After training, an explicit **softmax** layer is added to ensure per-cell probabilities are properly normalized.

### Validation (Quantized int8 Model)

On the **validation set**, the quantized (int8) model achieves:

* **F1 score (non-background):** `0.96`
* **Precision (non-background):** `0.98`
* **Recall (non-background):** `0.94`

### On-Device Performance (Nicla Vision)

Using the TensorFlow Lite engine for the **Arduino Nicla Vision**, Edge Impulse reports:

* **Inferencing time:** ≈ **61 ms** per frame
* **Peak RAM usage:** ≈ **137.7 KB**
* **Flash usage:** ≈ **81.3 KB**

This corresponds to roughly:

> **~16.3 frames per second (fps)**

which is sufficient for real-time detection and alerting on the helmet.

## 🚀 On-Device Deployment (OpenMV + MicroPython)

Deployment is done via the scripts in `deployment/OpenMV/`.

After training and validation:

* The model is exported from Edge Impulse as an **OpenMV-compatible library**
  (TFLite model + C++/MicroPython support code).
* The deployment is done via the **OpenMV IDE** onto the **Arduino Nicla Vision**.

The **final deployed script**:

* Is based on auto-generated Edge Impulse code
* The final deployed scripts are available in `deployment` folder.

### Runtime Behavior

At runtime, the MicroPython/OpenMV script running on Nicla Vision:

* Initializes:

  * Threee camera (RGB565, QVGA, 240×240 window)
  * Continuously:

  * Captures frames from the onboard camera
  * Applies the same preprocessing used during training
  * Runs **FOMO inference** on each frame
  * Draws bounding boxes and overlays the detected label on the image
  * The predictions of each camera is send to Raspberry PI and it connects to a bluetooth speaker for audio feedback.

This combination of real-time detection, visual overlays, and simple acoustic/visual alerts allows the Nicla Vision module to act as an **AI Helmet assistant** without any cloud processing.
